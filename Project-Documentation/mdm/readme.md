# BASIS Master Data Management (MDM)
The following list identifies data that has been collected for the Bay Area Spatial Information System platform.  These datasets support MTC's Analytical Services and Long Range Planning efforts and drive decision making and policy development across the agency.  The data is managed by the Data & Visualization Team, with assistance from key staff that have been identified as Data Stewards in various units across the agency. Data is stored and managed within MTC's Enterprise Data Lake, and disseminated through the Socrata Connected Government Cloud Data as a Service (DaaS) Platform.  
    
The data is grouped into five primary categories, and includes the following descriptive attributes:  
![MDM Detail](../images/dataset-detail.png) 
The domain values for the list above include the following:
- Sharing Permissions Domains: Private/ Internal, Public/ External
- Category Domains: Policy, Transportation, Land & People, Administrative Boundaries, Environment
- Data Format Domains: Geographic, Tabular, Document
- Unit of Analysis Domains: County, City, Zip, Tract, Block, Parcel, etc.  

## Data Collection and Review Process
Most of the data that is collected for BASIS and included in the MDM has been identified for its usefulness when conducting policy based analytical work.  Much of the data comes from local jurisdictions in the nine county San Francisco Bay Area region, while a few datasets come from Federal, State or Local Agencies.  The following figure provides a high level overview of the BASIS Data Processing Flow.

The following list contains key datasets listed on the [BASIS Website](http://basis.bayareametro.gov/results) that have been marked for inclusion in the MDM Data Store.
