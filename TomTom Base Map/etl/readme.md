## Problem Statement  

Make the source TomTom data accessible to various users at BayAreaMetro.  

## Data Sources

### Environment

This documentation assumes the user is running MacOS or similar with GDAL 1.11.5 or >.   

#### Notes on GDAL Install. 

We use GDAL because it gracefully handles the types in the DBF files that these data are delivered in.  

You may already have gdal installed. You can check at the command line with:  

`ogr2ogr --version` 

You should see something like: `GDAL 1.11.5, released 2016/07/01`

If not, we recommend installing GDAL via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):  

`brew install gdal`

### Download the source data. 

For convenience, these are organized into ISO files here:

- [MultiNet 2016 Source Data (MTC Staff Only)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tomtomdisks/tomtom_mn_2016_12.iso)    
- [Local Points of Interest 2016 Source Data (MTC Staff Only)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tomtomdisks/tomtom_lpoi_2016_12.iso)    

### Set up Files Up For Processing

Below we provide examples on how to set the files up. Please feel free to use, adapt, or use your own preferred method.

Copy the files off the disk after mounting it (in MacOS, double click on the ISO file).     

`cp -R /Volumes/mn612ushd_ca_dvd1/nam2016_12/shpd/. ~/Data/tt16`. 

Change permissions to allow file and folder changes in that directory. 

`chmod -R ug+rw ~/Data/tt16`

Move the files all into one directory (our script expects this).  

`mv ~/Data/tt16/mn/usa/*/*.gz ~/Data/tt16/mn/usa`  

Remove the (now empty) directories  

`rm -rf ax uc*`

Unzip all the files:

`gunzip -r ~/Data/tt16/mn/usa`

### Merge all the tables and shapefiles from each region together.   

TomTom delivers the data partitioned by geographic regions that are not relevant to us. Therefore, we merge them all together. 

You can use the following script to scan the directory of prepped files and execute (or optionally export) the necessary bash scripts to merge the tables and shapefiles together, output them to a sqlite database, and (optionally) write them to a PostgreSQL database.   

For example, using [this script](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/DataServices/blob/tomtom-etl-1/TomTom%20Base%20Map/etl/R/merge_tables.R)
